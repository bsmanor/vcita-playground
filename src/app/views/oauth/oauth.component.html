    <h2>This is a demo app that simulates how vcita users can grant app developers access to their vcita account, using OAuth.</h2>
    <h3>Access will be limited to only these endpoints accepting the OAuth token</h3>

    <h3>
        The current app will simulate a scenario where vcita users using the app can grant the developer access to generate an OAuth token, 
        in order to sync clients from their vcita account into the current app, so each time a new client is created on vcita, 
        vcita will send a notification to the app's dedicated endpoint with the new client's information, so that new client can be added to the list of clients on the the local app as well.
